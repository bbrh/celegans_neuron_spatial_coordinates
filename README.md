# celegans_neuron_spatial_coordinates


Very rough model of C.elegans neural coordinates. Taking 2d neuron position data from http://www.dynamic-connectome.org/?page_id=25, it is possible to extend it with a thrid coordinate, calculated by the following algorithm. All of the neurons, which label ends with "L" getting -r, ones with "R" getting r and everyone else gets 0.
